## Credits

This template was originally based on [vite-ts-react-tailwind-template](https://github.com/cpojer/vite-ts-react-tailwind-template). This fork has been updated with my own personal preferences and a better
eslint experience (thanks to [Antfu's ESLint Config](https://github.com/antfu/eslint-config)).
